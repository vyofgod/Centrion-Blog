In this article, we will examine the basic steps of the penetration testing process, methods used, and popular tools.\n1. What is Penetration Testing? Definition and Purpose Detecting security vulnerabilities Evaluating vulnerabilities Testing the effectiveness of security measures Meeting compliance requirements Types of Penetration Testing By Coverage Black Box Testing: Tests performed without prior knowledge about the system White Box Testing: Tests performed with full knowledge about the system Gray Box Testing: Tests performed with limited knowledge By Access Level External Network Tests Internal Network Tests Wireless Network Tests Physical Security Tests Social Engineering Tests Web Application Tests 2. Penetration Testing Stages 1. Planning and Reconnaissance Target Determination: Scope and rules of the test Information Gathering (OSINT): Gathering information from open sources Active Reconnaissance: Port scanning, service detection 2. Scanning and Vulnerability Analysis Port Scanning (Nmap) Service and Version Detection Vulnerability Scanning (Nessus, OpenVAS) 3. Exploitation Exploiting vulnerabilities Privilege Escalation Lateral/Vertical Movement 4. Maintaining Access Establishing Persistent Access Data Exfiltration Clearing Traces 5. Reporting Documentation of Findings Risk Assessment Improvement Recommendations 3. Basic Penetration Testing Tools Information Gathering Nmap: Network discovery and security auditing Recon-ng: Information gathering framework theHarvester: Email, domain, IP collection Vulnerability Scanning Nessus: Commercial vulnerability scanner OpenVAS: Open source vulnerability scanner Nikto: Web server scanner Exploitation Frameworks Metasploit Framework: Penetration testing platform Burp Suite: Web application security testing tool OWASP ZAP: Web application security scanner Password Cracking John the Ripper: Password cracking tool Hashcat: Advanced password cracking Hydra: Password cracking for network services Wireless Network Tests Aircrack-ng: Wireless network security tool Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer Kismet: Wireless network detector 4.

In this article, we will examine advanced network security concepts, threats, and effective defense strategies, going beyond basic security measures.\n1. Network Security Threats Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) Targeted and continuous attacks Usually carried out by state-sponsored actors Can remain undetected for long periods Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Previously unknown software vulnerabilities Can be exploited before patches are released Create high risk Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks Blocking services by consuming network resources Carried out using botnets Has different types (Volumetric, Protocol, Application Layer) 2.

In today\u0026rsquo;s digital world, cryptography is of vital importance in many areas, from banking transactions to personal messaging. In this article, we will examine basic cryptography concepts and how they are used in daily life.\n1. Basic Cryptography Concepts Encryption Plaintext: Unencrypted, readable data Ciphertext: Encrypted, unreadable data Key: Secret information used in encryption and decryption operations Algorithm: Mathematical functions that perform encryption Basic Encryption Types 1. Symmetric Encryption The same key is used for both encryption and decryption Advantages: Fast, requires less processing power Disadvantages: Key distribution is difficult Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish 2. Asymmetric Encryption Uses public key and private key Advantages: Provides secure key exchange Disadvantages: Slower, requires more processing power Examples: RSA, ECC, ElGamal 2. Modern Encryption Standards Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Uses 128, 192, or 256-bit key length Block encryption method (128-bit block size) Today\u0026rsquo;s most widely used symmetric encryption standard RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Based on the difficulty of factoring prime numbers Generally used for digital signatures and key exchange 2048-bit or longer keys are recommended Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Provides high security with shorter keys Ideal especially for mobile devices or devices with limited resources Widely used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 3. Cryptographic Hash Functions Features One-way (irreversible) The same input always produces the same output A small input change produces a completely different output Resistant to collisions Common Hash Functions SHA-2 Family: SHA-256, SHA-512 SHA-3: The newest standard BLAKE2: High-speed alternative 4. Digital Signatures and Certificates Digital Signatures Verifies the integrity of the document and the identity of the sender Uses asymmetric encryption The slightest change in the signed data invalidates the signature Digital Certificates Verifies ownership of a key pair Issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) Used in HTTPS connections on websites 5.

Basic Cryptography Concepts Encryption Plaintext: Unencrypted, readable data Ciphertext: Encrypted, unreadable data Key: Secret information used in encryption and decryption operations Algorithm: Mathematical functions that perform encryption Basic Encryption Types 1. Symmetric Encryption The same key is used for both encryption and decryption Advantages: Fast, requires less processing power Disadvantages: Key distribution is difficult Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish 2. Asymmetric Encryption Uses public key and private key Advantages: Provides secure key exchange Disadvantages: Slower, requires more processing power Examples: RSA, ECC, ElGamal 2.
